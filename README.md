# State-Charts

## Statechart Diagrams
While working on the statechart diagrams, use the development folder.
For now, use any file extension you'd like.  In the end they will be named .plantuml or something similar to make it obvious what they are.

## Documentation
Any documentation should go in the documentation folder (e.g. LaTeX files)
